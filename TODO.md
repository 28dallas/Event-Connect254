# Navbar Enhancement Plan

## Tasks
- [x] Update navbar background to glassmorphism style (bg-white/90 backdrop-blur-md border-b border-white/20)
- [x] Enhance logo with additional gradient effects and subtle animation
- [x] Add gradient hover effects to menu items (hover:bg-gradient-to-r hover:from-blue-50 hover:to-purple-50)
- [x] Update auth buttons with gradient backgrounds matching hero theme
- [x] Improve mobile menu styling with glassmorphism and better spacing
- [x] Add subtle scale transform on hover for interactive elements
- [ ] Ensure navbar looks good over hero section (test contrast)
- [ ] Verify responsiveness on different screen sizes

## Notes
- Use Tailwind classes for consistency
- Maintain existing functionality (auth, navigation, mobile menu)
- Follow project's color scheme: blues, yellows, pinks, oranges
- Incorporate glassmorphism like in HeroSection
